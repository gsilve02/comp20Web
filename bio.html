			Hello! I'm a sophomore undergraduate student at
			Tufts University <br/>studying computer science and clincial 
			psychology. <br/><br/> I've lived on the East Coast all of my life,
			but I spent the summer of 2016 <br/> on the West Coast at Stanford
			University. It was there that I discovered <br/>my passion for 
			coding. As soon as I returned to Tufts in the fall, <br/> I changed 
			my course of study. Soon after declared my major in <br/>computer 
			science while continuing my studies in clinical psychology. <br/><br/>
			I'm currently looking for a summer internship. I'm eager to 
			explore <br/>new areas and willing to consider relocating!
