This repository was built as my submission for Assignment 1 in COMP 20 at Tufts
University. 

I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment. There are no styling tags 
or attributes in any of the .html files; all of the styling was done in the .css 
files. No JavaScript, jQuery, or front-end frameworks were used, and especially 
no site generators were used. The website w3schools.com was used for reference 
on html tag attributes and css styling techniques. 

I spent approximately 10-12 hours working on the assignment, including time 
spent researching ways to complete the assignment without actually writing code.
