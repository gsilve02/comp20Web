# My Personal Website
*by Genevieve Silverman*

Welcome to the files that make my personal website! This website was built using
only HTML and CSS. No styling was done in the HTML files! The goal of doing this 
was to master using HTML and CSS, better understanding their nuances, before 
moving on to incorporate JavaScript and frameworks.

This website has been updated three times now already. Please go to 
[my current website](gsilve02.github.io) to see my most recent info. The repo
is also public on GitHub!
