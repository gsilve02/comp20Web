#My Personal Website
*by Genevieve Silverman*

Welcome to the files that make my personal website! This website was built using
only HTML and CSS. No styling was done in the HTML files! The goal of doing this 
was to master using HTML and CSS, better understanding their nuances, before 
moving on to incorporate JavaScript and/or a framework.

I plan to update this website in the future with a framework and make it 
interactive with JavaScript. I'm currently in the process of learning many new
web development tricks and techniques!
